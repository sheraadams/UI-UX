# Math Graphing and Calculator App User Research

## About the Project: 
The focus of this study is to ensure that the mobile and web calculation apps are accessible to those with visual impairments and that it is translated into each supported language (Nigerian and Spanish).

## Questions: 
•	Is the contrast sufficient for those with moderate visual impairment to see the content without additional visual aids?

•	Is the content alternative text correctly translated into Spanish?

•	Is the content alternative text correctly translated into Nigerian?

## Methodology:
We used a moderated study design, survey selection, and post-use interview format.  No responses were recorded, but answers were instead documented during the interview.

## KPIs (Key performance indicators)
•	Time on task

•	User error rates

•	System usability scale

•	Ease of use of navigation

# Personas 
Carla: As a visually impaired woman I want a more accessible user experience with high-contrast designs that are easy to read so that I can use the site like those without vision impairment.  
Problem: Carla is a moderately visually impaired student who needs a calculus learning application that uses a high-contrast design because neutral colors are difficult for her to see.

Shania: As a Latino American user, I want to have bilingual alternative texts available so that I can share the site with my Latino parents. 
Problem: Shania is a Spanish-speaking student who needs a calculus learning application that uses Spanish alternative texts because alternative texts help her to better understand the calculations. 

Rachel: As a Nigerian-American user, I want to have additional alternative texts available for website content so that I can share the site with my Nigerian parents. 
Problem: Rachel is a Nigerian-Speaking student who needs a calculus learning application that uses Nigerian alternative texts because alternative texts help her to better understand the calculations.

| Introduction | The focus of this study is to ensure that the mobile and web calculation apps are accessible to those with visual impairments and that it is translated into each supported language (Nigerian and Spanish).
| Research Questions	| •	Is the contrast sufficient for those with moderate visual impairment to see the content without additional visual aids? •	Is the content alternative text correctly translated into Spanish? •	Is the content alternative text correctly translated into Nigerian?|
| KPIS (Key performance indicators)	| Key performance indicators include: Time on task, user error rates, system usability scale, and use of navigation.|
| Methodology |	We used a moderated study design, survey selection, and post-use interview format.  No responses were recorded, but answers were instead documented during the interview. |
| Participants| anonymous |
| Target User |	Visually impaired, bilingual, Nigerian, and Spanish-speaking students. |
| Constraints |	6-week time constraint, limited budget, single developer / single designer, small team. |
| Key Insights	| •	Darker colors were preferred by those with visual impairment for higher contrast. •	Alternative texts were helpful in Spanish. •	Alternative texts were helpful in Nigerian. •	We also saw improved user engagement measures associated with alternative texts in English compared with no alternative texts for English users. |
